The ICT continuity requirements are the outcome of the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA process should use impact types and criteria to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of

The magnitude and duration of the resulting impact should be used to identify prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time objective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are needed to support prioritized activities. An RTO should also be specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should include ICT services.

The BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance and capacity requirements of ICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO) of information required to support activities during disruption.

Correspondence between different schemes can be determined by looking for equivalence in the associated handling and protection methods.
</p>","#Information_protection","<p>Classification provides people who deal with information with a concise indication of how to handle and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information security procedures that apply to all the information in each group facilitates this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls.

Information can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, when the information has been made public, it no longer has confidentiality requirements but can still require protection for its integrity and availability properties. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead to insufficient controls to protect the information from compromise.

As an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme can be based on four levels as follows:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>a) disclosure causes no harm;&nbsp;</li><li>b) disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational impact;&nbsp;</li><li>c) disclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or business objectives;&nbsp;</li><li>d) disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or puts the survival of the organization at risk

There are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC (discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control). Access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or specific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging from covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties such as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and how granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more granularity typically lead to higher cost.

Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong authentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Application code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults.

The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness.&nbsp;</p><p>Some web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
