For example, a threat event or TTP could assume specific technologies, architectures, or processes that are not present in the organization, mission/business process, EA segment, or information system; or predisposing conditions that are not present (e.g., location in a flood plain). Alternately, if the organization is using detailed or specific threat information, a threat event or TTP could be deemed inapplicable because information indicates that 
no adversary is expected to initiate the threat event or use the TTP.","N/A"
